This directory contains the source code for PIC microcontrollers.

The original target is the 'Revolt-LCD' AKA CougarLCD.  This is a
purpose built project that displays the serial output from the
OpenRevolt EV motor controller on a two line LCD display.  The hardware
is based on the PIC18F2480 processor, with serial, analog and CAN I/O.
The firmware is written in ASM, with no support for CAN.

Compile environment

The only universally available PIC compiler/environment is SDCC, thus
that is the primary target environment.

To build the firmware you'll need the following packages
apt-get install sdcc
