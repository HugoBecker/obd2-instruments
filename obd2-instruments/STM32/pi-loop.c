/* pi-loop.c: Proportional-integral loop for the VVVVroom motor controller. */
/*
 * The motor control Proportional-Integral loop code.
 * This version is based on the PI loop from the Open ReVolt Cougar firmware,
 * released under the GPL.  That allows us to start out with their tested
 * feedback parameters.
 *
 * This code implements the proportional-integral loop to set the motor
 * PWM control.  A PI control loop is a feedback controller which drives
 * the motor with a weighted sum of the error (difference between the output
 * and desired set-point) and the integral of that value.
 *
 * Using the integral term causes the steady-state error to reduce to zero,
 * which is not the case for proportional-only control in general.
 *
 * This loop runs at 4KHz.
