/* vvvv-stm32.c: STM32 specific routines for the VVVVroom motor controller. */
/*
  Written 2010-2011 by Donald Becker and William Carlson.

  These are the hardware interface routines for STM32 version of the
  VVVVroom motor controller.  While the entire design and structure is
  influenced by the features and performance of the specific controller
  chip, these are the functions that are most intimately tied to the
  specific device's registers and bits.

	This file contains the following subsystems
	Configuration data read and write, using flash instead of EEPROM
	Processor initialization, including clock configuration
	I/O port configuration
	A/D and PWM-timer configuration
	SPI initialization.

	Some hardware-specific details remain in the other subsystem code
	for convenience
	Updating the PWM percentage
	Reading the A/D converter values
	SPI reads and write
