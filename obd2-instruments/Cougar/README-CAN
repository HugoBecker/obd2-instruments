Instructions for adding CAN bus support to the Cougar firmware


Put these three files into the Cougar source directory

can-bus.c
can.h
cougar-exports.h

Add can-bus.o as a Makefile rule by inserting these three lines.

cougar.elf:	can-bus.o
can-bus.o:	CPFLAGS+=-DCOUGAR
can-bus.o:	cougar.h cougar-export.h can.h

Modify cougar.c around line 1090 to add the CAN polling function call:

		// do thermal cutback (based on real time data)
		thermal_cutback();
+		{ void CAN_poll(void);	CAN_poll(); }
		// if rtd_period not zero display rt data at specified intervals

Now the complicated part: modify can-bus.c to match your hardware.

This should mostly be changing the pin settings for the SPI lines.
Search for 'PORTB' and 'DDRB' as a start.

Consider using the raw_to_calibrated() function to report the controller
temperature.  The numbers in the table are completely made up, so you'll
eventually need to re-write the map.
